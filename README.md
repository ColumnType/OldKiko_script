## Old Kikọ
**Old kikọ** is an alphabetic cursive script developed for writing standard Yorùbá. The script can be written left to right - horizontally, and right to left - vertically. The typeface includes a number of opentype features that could be toggled with the layout editor of choice. Further work on this script has been discontinued in favor of developing a new Kiko script.
